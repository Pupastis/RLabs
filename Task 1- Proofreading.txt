High-Speed Analysis for a New Generation of Advanced Threats - Enabling Better Outcomes for Security and Businesses 

TitaniumCore performs advanced file analysis at millisecond speeds using a powerful engine to analyze files, offering a wide range of use cases and satisfying a wide variety of user demands, from just a few to a few billion samples daily.

The rules engine calculates threat levels based on rules provided by ReversingLabs and YARA rules supplied by the customer, offering unprecedented input scalability.
Extracted files can automatically be routed to additional analysing tools (i.e decompilers, debuggers, sandboxes, tools that run the files in a VM,) or an analyst for further human evaluation, based on the threat level and type. This enables the most efficient use of security assets. 

No other product (for example, sandboxes or scanners) exposes the breadth and depth of threat indicators extracted by TitaniumCore.
